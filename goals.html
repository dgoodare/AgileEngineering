      <h2>Sustainable Dundee's Goals</h2>



      <br>
      <p>These are our current goals aimed at both helping the local and global environment; and making the lives of our local community better (resulting in things such as reduced fuel poverty and improved air quality). Each goal we think is more than achievable, and we believe with a little work we can make Dundee a more sustainable city.
